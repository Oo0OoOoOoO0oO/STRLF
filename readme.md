# STRLF

**Towards Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning for EEG Classification in Motor Imagery-based BCI System**

----

This is the implementation of the STRLF architecture for EEG-MI classification.

## How to use

1. Download the data from the official website.
2. Use TRLN and SRLN to extract the temporal and spatial features.
3. Input the spatial and temporal features into `fusion.m` to obtain feature importance.
4. Select features based on importance and perform classification using FCNet.
